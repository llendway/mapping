In this demo, we are going to use `ggmap` to plot a bike ride I went on in Mallorca, Spain in 2018. First, let's take a quick look at the data. The data were originally from my Garmin in a GPX file. I used a function called `readGPX()` from the `plotKML` library to get it into R - GPX data are UG-LY!

Next, let's take a look at a map of [Mallorca](http://maps.stamen.com/#terrain/9/39.6078/3.0120) to get an idea of where it is for those who don't know. This is a stamen map, which is the same type of map we'll be bringing into R to make the map.


Now, let's get the map of Mallorca. To decide the `bbox` values, I go to [openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), put in my location, set to the right zoom, and click export. Then, I use the numbers in the corresponding boxes. This map also has a zoom number, as did the stamen map in the link above.

```{r}
mallorca_map <- get_stamenmap(
    bbox = c(left = , bottom = , right = , top = ), 
    maptype = "terrain",
    zoom = 
)
```


And, let's plot the map to make sure it looks like what we expected:

```{r}
ggmap()
```

Now, we are going to plot the ride I went on (on the 7th day I was there). Let's start by plotting points. 

```{r}
ggmap() +
  geom_point(data = , 
            aes(x = , y = ),
            size = .3) +
  theme_map()
```

I want to make some changes, including:

* Zooming in on the map more (ie. change `bbox` argument)  
* Make the ride a line, rather than a point (use `geom_path()` rather than `geom_line()` to connect the points in order)  
* Color the line by elevation and change the color scale
* Eliminate the background color of the legend so it doesn't overlap the map

```{r}
mallorca_map <- get_stamenmap(
    bbox = c(left = , bottom = , right = , top = ), 
    maptype = "terrain",
    zoom = 11
)
ggmap() +
  geom_path(data = , 
             aes(x = , y = , color = ),
             size = .5) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = ) +
  theme_map() +
  theme()
```
